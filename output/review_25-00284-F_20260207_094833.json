Cycle Parking\n\n**Status: Cannot Assess - No Information Provided**\n\n#### Required Standards (LTN 1/20 Chapter 14):\nFor B2/B8 employment uses, the application must demonstrate:\n\n- **Quantum:** Number of cycle parking spaces based on employee numbers and visitor requirements\n- **Type:** Mix of short-stay (Sheffield stands, minimum) and long-stay (covered, secure) facilities\n- **Location:** Within 50m of building entrances, more convenient than car parking\n- **Security:** Covered, well-lit, CCTV monitored for long-stay\n- **Quality:** Compliance with Table 14.1 of LTN 1/20\n\n**Critical Concern:** The proposal mentions \"cycle parking\" but provides no detail whatsoever on:\n- How many spaces?\n- Where located on site?\n- What type/quality?\n- How secured?\n\nThis is wholly inadequate for a major employment allocation.\n\n#### Policy Non-Compliance:\n- **LTN 1/20 Chapter 14.3.17:** \"The design of cycle facilities within new highways constructed in developments should adhere to the guidance given in the relevant chapters contained in this document... the expectation is that high quality cycle facilities should be provided in all new developments.\"\n- **NPPF para 109(e):** \"identifying and pursuing opportunities to promote walking, cycling and public transport use\"\n\n### 2. Cycle Route Provision\n\n**Status: Critical Failure - No Evidence of Assessment**\n\n#### Site Context Issues:\n\nThis site is located on the **Wendlebury parish boundary near Chesterton**, which presents severe challenges for sustainable access:\n\n**Distance Analysis (estimated):**\n- Chesterton village: ~1km\n- Bicester town centre: ~4-5km  \n- M40 Junction 9: Adjacent (hostile environment)\n- A41: Direct frontage (60mph dual carriageway)\n\n**Existing Infrastructure Assessment:**\nAccording to the Bicester LCWIP, the cycle network quality in this area is likely to be poor or non-existent. The site appears to be in a rural/edge location with:\n- No existing cycle routes to the site\n- A41 providing severance and danger\n- Rural roads without cycle provision\n- Significant distance from residential areas\n\n#### What Should Be Provided:\n\n**On-site (LTN 1/20 Chapter 14):**\n- Internal cycle network meeting Core Design Principles (Coherent, Direct, Safe, Comfortable, Attractive)\n- Segregated cycle tracks where motor traffic volume/speed warrants (Figure 4.1)\n- Dutch-style junction treatments\n- Design speed of 30 kph (Table 5-4) minimum, 20 kph absolute minimum\n\n**Off-site Connectivity:**\nThe application **must** demonstrate safe cycle routes from:\n1. Bicester town centre (nearest significant residential area)\n2. Chesterton village\n3. Wendlebury (if applicable)\n4. Any public transport nodes\n\n**LTN 1/20 Figure 4.1 Requirements:**\nFor the A41 (assumed >40mph, >6000 PCU/day), **protected space for cycling is mandatory** - either:\n- Stepped cycle tracks (minimum 2.0m width, Table 5-2)\n- Fully kerbed cycle tracks\n- Light segregation (if HGV traffic limited and <6000 PCU/day)\n\nShared use paths on footways are **not acceptable** in urban contexts (LTN 1/20 6.5.4: \"should be regarded as a last resort\").\n\n#### Policy Non-Compliance:\n- **LTN 1/20 14.3.19:** \"A cycle network plan should be included in the design code\"\n- **Bicester LCWIP Policy:** Developments must provide \"safe and attractive walking and cycling connections to the site\"\n- **Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2(b):** \"all new developments have safe and attractive walking and cycling connections to the site\"\n\n**No evidence provided of any cycle connectivity assessment.**\n\n### 3. Junction Design\n\n**Status: Critical Failure - No Information**\n\n#### A41 Signalised Access:\n\nThe proposal accesses from \"the existing A41 signalised access\" but provides **no information** on:\n\n- How cyclists will safely cross the A41\n- Junction design for cycle movements\n- Integration with any Toucan crossings\n- Compliance with LTN 1/20 Chapter 6 junction standards\n\n**LTN 1/20 Requirements:**\n\nThe junction must provide (Chapter 6):\n- Separate cycle signal phases where necessary\n- Avoid shared use areas forcing conflict (6.5.4)\n- Protected space through junction (Figure 4.1)\n- Appropriate deflection and geometry for cycle safety\n- Consideration of design speed (minimum 20 kph, Table 5-4)\n\n**Specific Concern - HGV Movements:**\n\nB8 (storage/distribution) uses generate significant HGV traffic. The junction design must demonstrate:\n- Safe separation of cycle movements from HGV turning movements\n- Adequate visibility splays for all users\n- Protection from swept paths of articulated vehicles\n- Compliance with LTN 1/20 junction design principles\n\n#### Policy Non-Compliance:\n- **NPPF para 115(a):** Applications must \"give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements\"\n- **NPPF para 115(b):** Must ensure \"safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users\"\n- **LTN 1/20 Chapter 6:** Extensive junction design requirements not addressed\n\n### 4. Pedestrian & Cycle Permeability\n\n**Status: Cannot Assess - No Information**\n\n#### Required Assessment:\n\nFor a site of this scale, the application must demonstrate:\n\n**Internal Permeability:**\n- Walking routes to/from all employment areas to cycle parking\n- Maximum 50m from any workplace to cycle parking\n- Pedestrian priority within site\n- Filtered permeability (cyclists can move freely, motor traffic controlled)\n\n**External Permeability:**\n- How pedestrians/cyclists access the site from surrounding area\n- Connections to existing PRoW network\n- Desire line analysis\n- Barrier removal (A41 severance, M40 proximity)\n\n**LTN 1/20 Chapter 14.3.15-16:**\nNetworks must be:\n- **Coherent:** Legible routes forming a high-quality grid\n- **Direct:** Following desire lines, not circuitous\n- **Safe:** Protected from motor traffic danger\n- **Comfortable:** Smooth surfaces, adequate width, low gradients\n- **Attractive:** Pleasant environment encouraging use\n\n**No evidence of any permeability assessment provided.**\n\n#### Policy Non-Compliance:\n- **Manual for Streets:** Walking/cycling routes should be more direct than motor routes\n- **Bicester LCWIP Outcome 3:** Need to address \"disconnected street network and significant severance\"\n- **Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2(b):** Internal routes must \"connect easily and conveniently to community facilities and the local cycle and walking network\"\n\n### 5. Transport Assessment Review\n\n**Status: CRITICAL - No Transport Assessment Available**\n\n#### NPPF Requirements:\n\n**Paragraph 118:** \"All developments that will generate significant amounts of movement should be required to provide a travel plan, and the application should be supported by a vision-led transport statement or transport assessment.\"\n\nThis B2/B8 employment development will **unquestionably** generate significant movements. The absence of a Transport Assessment is a fundamental policy failure.\n\n#### What the TA Should Include:\n\n1. **Trip Generation:**\n   - Employee numbers (AM/PM peaks)\n   - Visitor numbers\n   - HGV movements\n   - Baseline modal split assumptions\n\n2. **Modal Shift Analysis:**\n   - Current modal split for employment sites\n   - Target modal split (with cycling infrastructure)\n   - Measures to achieve targets\n   - Link to Travel Plan\n\n3. **Cycle Demand Assessment:**\n   - Catchment area analysis\n   - Potential cycle trips from residential areas\n   - Justification for cycle parking provision\n   - Network capacity requirements\n\n4. **Impact Assessment:**\n   - Effects on existing cycle routes (if any)\n   - Junction safety analysis for all modes\n   - Cumulative impact with other developments\n\n5. **Mitigation Measures:**\n   - On-site cycle infrastructure\n   - Off-site improvements to cycle network\n   - Contribution to Bicester LCWIP schemes\n   - Monitoring and enforcement\n\n#### Likely Issues (Based on Site Context):\n\nWithout seeing the TA, the following concerns are anticipated:\n\n**Modal Split Assumptions:**\n- Out-of-town employment sites typically assume 90%+ car mode share\n- This is policy non-compliant with NPPF \"vision-led\" approach\n- Should demonstrate how 10-20% cycle mode share can be achieved\n\n**Accessibility:**\n- Site appears to have very poor cycle accessibility\n- May be \"predict and provide\" car-based approach\n- Conflicts with NPPF para 110 sustainable location requirements\n\n**Network Impact:**\n- Likely to generate hundreds of car trips in peak hours\n- Impact on A41/local network not assessed\n- Cycling alternatives not properly considered\n\n#### Policy Non-Compliance:\n- **NPPF para 118:** Mandatory requirement for TA/TS not met\n- **NPPF Glossary (Transport Assessment):** Must \"identify measures required to support alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling\"\n- **NPPF para 109:** \"Vision-led approach to identify transport solutions\" - no evidence of this\n\n### 6. Travel Plan\n\n**Status: CRITICAL - No Travel Plan Submitted**\n\n#### NPPF Requirements:\n\n**Paragraph 118** requires a Travel Plan for all developments generating significant movement.\n\n**NPPF Glossary Definition:** Travel Plan is \"a long-term management strategy for an organisation or site that details how agreed sustainable transport objectives are to be delivered.\"\n\n#### Required Travel Plan Content:\n\nFor a B2/B8 employment development, the Travel Plan must include:\n\n1. **Baseline Assessment:**\n   - Current travel patterns to site\n   - Accessibility by all modes\n   - Barriers to cycling/walking\n\n2. **Targets:**\n   - Specific modal shift targets (e.g., 15% cycle mode share by Year 3)\n   - Reduction in single-occupancy car trips\n   - Measurable, time-bound objectives\n\n3. **Measures:**\n   - Cycle parking provision (quantity/quality)\n   - Changing/shower facilities for cyclists\n   - Cycle purchase schemes/loans\n   - Cycle training for employees\n   - Guaranteed ride home scheme\n   - Car parking management/pricing\n   - Personalised travel planning\n   - Bicycle user group\n\n4. **Infrastructure Commitments:**\n   - On-site cycle routes\n   - Off-site improvements\n   - Financial contributions to cycle network\n\n5. **Monitoring & Review:**\n   - Annual travel surveys\n   - Review of targets\n   - Remedial measures if targets not met\n   - Secured through Section 106 agreement\n\n**No Travel Plan has been submitted.**\n\n#### Policy Non-Compliance:\n- **NPPF para 118:** Mandatory requirement not met\n- **Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2:** Developments must demonstrate sustainable transport provision\n- **Bicester LCWIP:** Employment sites must contribute to modal shift targets\n\n## Policy Compliance Matrix\n\n| Requirement | Policy Source | Compliant? | Notes |\n|-------------|---------------|------------|-------|\n| Transport Assessment | NPPF para 118 | ❌ NO | Not submitted |\n| Travel Plan | NPPF para 118 | ❌ NO | Not submitted |\n| Priority to pedestrian/cycle movements | NPPF para 117(a) | ❌ NO | No evidence of prioritisation |\n| Safe access for all users | NPPF para 115(b) | ❌ UNKNOWN | Cannot assess without TA |\n| Vision-led approach | NPPF para 109, 115 | ❌ NO | No vision for sustainable access |\n| Cycle network plan | LTN 1/20 14.3.19 | ❌ NO | Not provided |\n| Cycle parking standards | LTN 1/20 Chapter 14 | ❌ UNKNOWN | No details provided |\n| Protected cycle space on A41 | LTN 1/20 Figure 4.1 | ❌ UNKNOWN | No route details provided |\n| Junction design for cycles | LTN 1/20 Chapter 6 | ❌ UNKNOWN | No junction designs provided |\n| Safe cycle connections | Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2(b) | ❌ NO | Not demonstrated |\n| Integration with Bicester LCWIP | Bicester LCWIP | ❌ NO | No reference to LCWIP routes |\n| Cycle route design standards | LTN 1/20 Table 5-2, 5-4 | ❌ UNKNOWN | No routes designed |\n| Filtered permeability | LTN 1/20 Chapter 14.3.15 | ❌ UNKNOWN | Not addressed |\n| Coherent network provision | LTN 1/20 14.3.15 | ❌ NO | No network demonstrated |\n| Design code with cycle facilities | LTN 1/20 14.3.18-19 | ❌ NO | Not provided |\n| Consideration of disabled users | NPPF para 117(b) | ❌ UNKNOWN | Not addressed |\n| Sustainable location | NPPF para 110 | ❌ LIKELY NO | Out-of-town site, poor accessibility |\n\n**Compliance Score: 0/17 assessable requirements met**\n\n## Site-Specific Concerns\n\n### Location & Sustainability\n\nThis site raises fundamental questions about compliance with NPPF para 110:\n\n> \"Significant development should be focused on locations which are or can be made sustainable, through limiting the need to travel and offering a genuine choice of transport modes.\"\n\n**Questions for the Applicant:**\n\n1. **Can this site be \"made sustainable\"?** \n   - It appears to be 4-5km from Bicester, adjacent to the M40/A41\n   - Creating safe cycle routes across this distance would require significant off-site infrastructure\n   - No evidence this has been considered or costed\n\n2. **Does it offer \"genuine choice of transport modes\"?**\n   - No bus service information provided\n   - Cycle accessibility appears very poor\n   - Walking distance to residential areas excessive\n   - Likely to be 95%+ car-dependent\n\n3. **Is this an appropriate location for employment development from a sustainable transport perspective?**\n   - Prima facie appears to fail NPPF para 110 test\n   - Should be compared against alternative sites closer to Bicester with better active travel potential\n\n### Integration with Bicester LCWIP\n\nThe Bicester LCWIP identifies significant challenges with cycle infrastructure and sets out a comprehensive network plan. This development must demonstrate:\n\n1. **Contribution to LCWIP Network:**\n   - Which LCWIP routes does it connect to?\n   - What off-site improvements are needed?\n   - Financial contribution to scheme delivery?\n\n2. **LCWIP Outcome Alignment:**\n   - **Outcome 1:** \"Delivering missing links\" - what links does this create?\n   - **Outcome 3:** \"Better physical linking\" - how does this address severance?\n   - **Outcome 5:** \"Ease of movement for all\" - is this accessible to all ages/abilities?\n   - **Outcome 6:** \"Shift away from private car use\" - what modal shift will this achieve?\n\n**The application makes no reference to the Bicester LCWIP.**\n\nThis is a significant policy failure given Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2(c): \"Work closely with stakeholders using co-production methods when developing and improving cycle and walking networks.\"\n\n### HGV/Cycle Interaction\n\nB8 (storage and distribution) uses generate significant HGV movements. The application must address:\n\n1. **Routing:** How are HGVs routed to avoid conflict with cycle routes?\n2. **Junction Design:** How are cycles protected from HGV swept paths and blind spots?\n3. **Site Layout:** Are cycle routes segregated from HGV circulation areas?\n4. **Safety Assessment:** Specific HGV-cycle conflict risk assessment required\n\n**No information provided on any of these critical safety issues.**\n\n## Recommendations\n\nGiven the complete absence of transport documentation, this application should be **REFUSED** or at minimum deemed **INVALID** until the following are submitted:\n\n### Essential Information Required:\n\n1. **Transport Assessment** including:\n   - Full trip generation and modal split analysis\n   - Cycle accessibility assessment (5km+ catchment)\n   - Detailed junction impact assessment (A41 and estate road)\n   - Vision-led approach demonstrating how sustainable travel will be prioritised\n   - Assessment of cycle route requirements (on and off-site)\n   - Contribution to Bicester LCWIP delivery\n\n2. **Travel Plan** including:\n   - Specific cycle mode share targets (minimum 15% within 3 years)\n   - Package of measures to achieve targets\n   - Monitoring and enforcement mechanisms\n   - Secured through Section 106 agreement\n\n3. **Cycle Infrastructure Strategy** including:\n   - Cycle parking provision (quantum, type, location, security)\n   - On-site cycle network plan with design code\n   - Off-site route improvements required\n   - Junction designs complying with LTN 1/20\n   - Integration with Bicester LCWIP\n\n4. **Site Layout Plans** showing:\n   - Cycle parking locations\n   - Cycle route alignments\n   - Pedestrian/cycle priority areas\n   - Filtered permeability measures\n   - Junction designs\n\n5. **Design & Access Statement** addressing:\n   - Cycle accessibility for all ages/abilities\n   - Provision for disabled cyclists\n   - Wayfinding and signage strategy\n   - Maintenance and management of cycle infrastructure\n\n### Specific Design Requirements:\n\nIf the application is to be reconsidered, the following must be demonstrated:\n\n#### Cycle Parking:\n\n- **Quantum:** Minimum 1 space per 150m² employment floorspace (long-stay) + 10% visitor provision\n- **Type:** Covered, secure, well-lit long-stay (lockers or compound);
