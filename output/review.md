## Critical Deficiency

**No application documents have been retrieved for review.** This represents a fundamental failure to provide adequate information for a development of this scale and complexity. Given the nature and scale of this proposal, the absence of key transport documents is a serious concern.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Missing Documentation

For a development of this scale and mixed-use nature, the following documents should be submitted but appear to be absent:

**Essential Transport Documents:**
- Transport Assessment or Transport Statement (required by NPPF para 118)
- Travel Plan
- Active Travel Strategy
- Cycle Parking Strategy
- Pedestrian and Cycle Network Plan
- Access and Movement Plans
- Design Code including cycle infrastructure specifications

**Policy Requirement:**
NPPF paragraph 118 states: \"All developments that will generate significant amounts of movement should be required to provide a travel plan, and the application should be supported by a vision-led transport statement or transport assessment so that the likely impacts of the proposal can be assessed and monitored.\"

This development clearly meets the threshold for \"significant amounts of movement\" given its scale and mixed uses.

### 2. Location & Accessibility Context

**Bucknell Context:**
Bucknell is a small village located approximately 4km west of Bicester town centre. The site is on Bainton Road, in a rural location with limited existing active travel infrastructure.

**Accessibility Concerns:**
- Remote rural location with no existing cycle infrastructure
- Distance from Bicester (~4km) places it beyond comfortable walking distance but within cycling distance for confident cyclists
- No indication of how the site will connect to the Bicester LCWIP network
- Likely car-dependent location without significant infrastructure investment

**Policy Conflict:**
NPPF paragraph 110 requires that \"significant development should be focused on locations which are or can be made sustainable, through limiting the need to travel and offering a genuine choice of transport modes.\"

### 3. Scale and Trip Generation

The proposed development includes:
- Hotels (overnight accommodation generating AM/PM peaks)
- Theatres (evening entertainment generating significant trip clustering)
- Restaurants (varied timing)
- Conference facilities (weekday business trips)
- Offices (daily commuting)
- Warehousing and storage (freight and employee movements)
- Medical centre (healthcare trips)

**This mix will generate substantial traffic throughout the day and evening**, with particular concentrations during theatre performances and conference events.

**Missing Information:**
- No trip generation estimates
- No modal split targets
- No assessment of how sustainable transport modes will be encouraged
- No parking restraint measures identified

### 4. Active Travel Routes - Inadequate Detail

The application description mentions \"internal footpaths,\" \"internal vehicular routes,\" and \"active travel routes\" but provides:

❌ No design standards reference (LTN 1/20 compliance)
❌ No network plan showing connectivity
❌ No width specifications
❌ No segregation proposals for pedestrian/cycle routes
❌ No junction treatment details
❌ No surface material specifications
❌ No lighting strategy
❌ No connection to existing infrastructure

**LTN 1/20 Requirements:**

For a development of this nature, LTN 1/20 Chapter 14 (Planning for Cycling in New Developments) requires:

- **Section 14.3.17:** \"Design of cycle facilities within new highways constructed in developments should adhere to the guidance given in the relevant chapters contained in this document. Typically, there are few constraints preventing designers from meeting desirable geometric standards and so the expectation is that high quality cycle facilities should be provided in all new developments.\"

- **Section 14.3.19:** \"A cycle network plan should be included in the design code, setting out what type of route (off-carriageway cycle track, on-carriageway, or greenway) will be provided in each location as part of the overall layout. The design code should include typical cross-sections for the different types of route.\"

**None of this has been provided.**

### 5. Cycle Parking

**Complete absence of information on:**
- Quantum of cycle parking for each use
- Location of cycle parking facilities
- Type of parking (covered, secure, Sheffield stands, etc.)
- Accessibility of cycle parking
- Shower/changing facilities for staff
- Visitor vs staff parking provision

**For comparison with policy expectations:**

A development of this scale and mix would typically require:
- **Hotels:** 1 space per 5 bedrooms (staff) + visitor parking
- **Theatres:** 1 space per 10 seats (minimum)
- **Restaurants:** 1 space per 100m² + staff parking
- **Offices:** 1 space per 100m² + shower facilities
- **Conference facilities:** 1 space per 10 delegates
- **Medical centre:** Significant provision for staff and patients

Without knowing the scale of each element, precise numbers cannot be calculated, but **several hundred cycle parking spaces would be expected**.

### 6. External Connectivity

**Critical Gap:** No information on how people will reach the site by cycle from:
- Bicester town centre (4km)
- Bicester North station
- Surrounding villages
- Proposed housing developments

**Bainton Road Context:**
Bainton Road is a rural road with no existing cycle infrastructure. At 4km from Bicester centre, it should be served by a high-quality segregated cycle route to encourage mode shift.

**LTN 1/20 Figure 4.1 Requirements:**
Based on traffic volumes and speeds on rural roads approaching Bicester, LTN 1/20 Figure 4.1 would require **protected space for cycling** (fully kerbed cycle tracks, stepped cycle tracks, or light segregation) rather than on-carriageway cycling.

**Missing:**
- No proposal for off-site cycle route to Bicester
- No Section 278 or Section 106 contributions identified
- No integration with Bicester LCWIP priorities

**Bicester LCWIP Context:**
The Bicester LCWIP emphasizes the need for comprehensive cycle networks connecting all developments to the town centre. Policy 2 of the Oxfordshire LTCP states: \"Ensure that all new developments have safe and attractive walking and cycling connections to the site.\"

### 7. Vision-Led Approach Failure

**NPPF paragraph 109 requires a \"vision-led approach\" to transport planning.**

This means setting outcomes for sustainable, popular places and providing transport solutions to deliver those outcomes.

**Evidence of vision-led thinking: NONE**

The application description lists uses and mentions \"active travel routes\" but demonstrates no strategic thinking about:
- Target modal splits
- How visitors/staff will be encouraged to arrive sustainably
- Integration with public transport
- Car parking restraint
- Design quality of streets and public realm

**NPPF paragraph 117(a) requires:** \"give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and with neighbouring areas\"

No evidence this principle has been applied.

### 8. Junction Design & Site Access

**Completely absent:**
- Access arrangements from Bainton Road
- Junction design details
- Cycle priority at junctions
- Pedestrian crossing facilities
- Sight lines for emerging cyclists

**LTN 1/20 Chapter 6 (Junctions) requires:**
- Cycle priority at side roads
- Minimal deflection for through cyclists
- Protected junction designs where cycle flows warrant

**Without junction details, it is impossible to assess:**
- Safety for cycling
- Compliance with LTN 1/20
- Conflict points with motor traffic

### 9. Internal Layout & Permeability

The proposal mentions \"internal vehicular routes\" and \"internal footpaths\" separately from \"active travel routes.\"

**This separation is concerning** as it suggests:
- Cycling may be relegated to shared paths rather than having equal priority
- Street design may prioritize motor vehicles
- Filtered permeability may not be provided

**LTN 1/20 Chapter 14 and Manual for Streets principles require:**
- Cycle routes forming a permeable grid throughout the site
- Filtered permeability allowing cycle shortcuts denied to motor traffic
- Design speeds appropriate for mixed use streets (20mph maximum)

**Questions that cannot be answered:**
- Will there be through routes for cycling denied to motor vehicles?
- Will internal streets be designed to 20mph standards?
- Will cycle routes be more direct than vehicular routes?
- How will conflicts between HGVs (servicing warehousing) and cyclists be managed?

## Specific Concerns

### A. Rural Location & Car Dependency

This is fundamentally a **car-dependent location** unless significant infrastructure investment is made. The application shows no evidence of:
- Understanding this constraint
- Proposing solutions
- Committing to funding off-site infrastructure

**For a tourism/leisure/conference facility in this location, car mode share could easily exceed 85-90%** without significant intervention.

### B. Conflict with Sustainable Development Principles

NPPF paragraph 110 requires significant development to be \"focused on locations which are or can be made sustainable.\"

**This site, without substantial infrastructure, does not meet this test.**

### C. Trip Timing & Clustering

Theatre and conference uses create **concentrated arrival/departure patterns** that:
- Overwhelm local infrastructure at specific times
- Make sustainable transport provision more challenging
- Require parking surge capacity

Without a Transport Assessment, the impacts cannot be understood.

### D. Warehousing & HGV Movements

The inclusion of \"warehousing and storage\" introduces **HGV movements** that create:
- Significant safety concerns for cycling
- Need for segregated infrastructure
- Design complications at junctions

No assessment of this conflict has been provided.

### E. Scale & Phasing Unknown

As an outline application \"with all matters reserved,\" the scale is unknown:
- Number of hotel rooms
- Theatre capacity
- Office floorspace
- Conference delegate capacity

**This makes meaningful transport assessment impossible.**

However, even at the lower end of plausible scales, this development would generate **thousands of daily trips**.

## Recommendations

## Summary

This application **fundamentally fails to provide adequate information** to assess its transport and active travel impacts. For a large-scale, mixed-use development in a rural location, the absence of:

- Transport Assessment
- Travel Plan 
- Active Travel Strategy
- Cycle Parking Strategy
- Design Code with cycle infrastructure details

...constitutes a **material deficiency that prevents proper consideration** of the application.

The proposal mentions \"active travel routes\" but provides no detail on design standards, connectivity, or compliance with national guidance (LTN 1/20) or local policy (Bicester LCWIP, Oxfordshire LTCP).

Given the rural location approximately 4km from Bicester, **this development risks being highly car-dependent** unless significant infrastructure investment creates genuine alternatives. No such investment is proposed or even outlined.

**The application should be refused** as currently submitted, with the applicant invited to resubmit with comprehensive transport documentation meeting the requirements set out above.

---

**Rating: RED - Objection recommended**

**Key message:** Inadequate information to assess. Application fails to demonstrate compliance with sustainable transport policies. Significant risk of car-dependent development without evidence of adequate active travel provision.
