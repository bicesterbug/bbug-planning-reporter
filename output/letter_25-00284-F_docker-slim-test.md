Dear Sir/Madam

Cherwell District Council
Planning Department

**Re: Planning Application 25/00284/F — OS Parcel 3371 Adjoining Wendlebury Parish Boundary, Chesterton**

## Objection to Proposed Employment Development

Bicester Bike Users' Group (Bicester BUG) writes to **formally object** to the above planning application for employment development totalling 163,338 square metres across nine units. Despite providing 1,218 cycle parking spaces, this application fails to deliver the safe, coherent cycle infrastructure necessary to make those spaces usable. The proposed development is contrary to national policy requirements in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, December 2024), the design standards in Local Transport Note 1/20 (LTN 1/20, July 2020), Oxfordshire County Council's Local Transport and Connectivity Plan, Cherwell Local Plan Policy SLE4, and the objectives of the Bicester Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan.

## Critical Infrastructure Failures

### Unsafe and Incomplete Off-Site Cycle Connections

The most serious deficiency in this application is the complete absence of safe, direct cycle routes connecting the site to Bicester town centre (4 kilometres away) and surrounding communities. This represents a fundamental failure to comply with paragraph 115(a) of the NPPF, which requires that opportunities to maximise sustainable transport solutions be taken, and with paragraph 117(a), which requires developments to give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements.

**The A41 Connection Failure**

The site benefits from a consented signalised access on the A41 with toucan crossings. A previous application for the Siemens development (reference 22/01144/F, approved 2022) secured a contribution of £2.8 million for a shared footway/cycleway between the site and Bicester Park & Ride. Three years later, this route remains undesigned, undelivered, and unfunded. Oxfordshire County Council's consultation response from Rashid Bbosa states that "Active Travel provisions associated with this access do not provide a direct route into Bicester besides linking to Footpaths 398/1/20 and 161/4/20." The County Council now requires safeguarding of "a strip of land along their frontages on the A41 for this infrastructure," yet **the application fails to demonstrate this safeguarding within the redline boundary or any commitment to delivery**.

This failure is contrary to Section 14.3.17 of LTN 1/20, which states that "high quality cycle facilities should be provided in all new developments," and to Section 14.3.15, which requires cycle networks to be "Coherent" — meaning they join up and connect to existing cycle networks. Without a safe connection to Bicester's existing cycling infrastructure, this development creates an isolated employment site accessible only by car.

**The Green Lane Safety Critical Issue**

The application proposes a 3.7-metre-wide emergency access/pedestrian route northwards to Green Lane, connecting to a 2-metre footway. This route **terminates unsafely at an unnamed junction** where, according to Oxfordshire County Council, "pedestrians would be forced to walk on the narrow carriageway towards Chesterton along a 40mph signed speed limit section." The County Council identifies this as a **"Reason for Objection"** and requires extension to Vespasian Way.

Active Travel England's response highlights that "The 40mph speed limit along this route is concerning, particularly with regards to crossings." The onward route crosses footpath 161/1/120, which Active Travel England notes is "unlikely to be suitable for most users at all times of the day and year."

This design is contrary to Figure 4.1 of LTN 1/20, which clearly shows that on roads with 40mph or higher speed limits, protected space for cycling is required — not shared-use footways. Section 6.5.4 of LTN 1/20 states that "In urban areas, the conversion of a footway to shared use should be regarded as a last resort." The proposed Green Lane connection fails to provide protected space and would force cyclists onto a 40mph carriageway, creating a dangerous and unusable route.

Furthermore, Table 5-2 of LTN 1/20 specifies that for two-way cycle tracks serving this level of development, a minimum width of 3.0 metres is required (with 4.0 metres desirable). The proposed 3.7-metre width is intended to serve as both an emergency vehicle access and a pedestrian/cycle route, leaving insufficient width for safe, segregated cycling provision.

### Failure to Demonstrate Coherent Networks

These connectivity failures mean the application does not comply with paragraph 110 of the NPPF, which requires that development should only be permitted in locations which are or can be made sustainable through limiting the need to travel and offering a genuine choice of transport modes. The development cannot be made sustainable when the promised cycling infrastructure from 2022 remains undelivered and this application makes no binding commitment to deliver it before occupation.

The proposal is also contrary to Policy SLE1 of the Cherwell Local Plan Part 1, which requires employment proposals to have good access by sustainable modes of transport, and to the Bicester Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan, which identifies the need for comprehensive networks accessible from every neighbourhood. This development does the opposite: it creates an isolated employment site requiring 1,800+ employees to travel daily with no safe cycling option.

## Cycle Parking Quality Concerns

While the quantity of 1,218 cycle parking spaces exceeds the minimum requirement of 1,185 spaces, the **quality and accessibility** of this provision are fundamentally compromised by the reliance on double-stacking. Paragraph 4.15 of the Transport Assessment states that parking "will be achieved through provision of double-stacked spaces."

Section 11.2.7 of LTN 1/20 is explicit: "Two-tier cycle parking should only be considered where there is very high demand and space is at a premium." This is a large greenfield site with no space constraints that would justify double-stacking. Double-stacked parking discriminates against:

- Less physically able users who cannot lift bicycles to upper racks
- Wheelchair users
- Users of cargo bikes, adapted cycles, tandems, and tricycles
- Users of mobility scooters
- Parents with child seats or trailers

Oxfordshire County Council's parking standards require provision for "cycles for disabled people and other needs (such as tricycles, cargo bikes, tandems, mobility scooters and adapted bicycles)." Double-stacked spaces cannot accommodate these cycles. This represents a failure to comply with the Public Sector Equality Duty under Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010.

Active Travel England's consultation response specifically states that "detailed cycle parking drawings are absent" and requests these drawings "to ensure compliance with LTN 1/20 and local standards." Chapter 11 of LTN 1/20 sets out detailed requirements for cycle parking quality, including weather protection (Table 11-1), security, and proximity to building entrances. None of these requirements have been demonstrated through detailed drawings showing:

- Covered provision with adequate clearances
- Sheffield stands or equivalent at ground level
- Natural surveillance from building entrances
- Locations within 20 metres of entrances
- Lighting and CCTV provision
- Segregation from vehicle traffic
- Inclusive provision for adapted cycles

Without these details, the Local Planning Authority cannot be satisfied that the cycle parking will meet the quality standards necessary to encourage cycling, as required by Chapter 11 of LTN 1/20 and paragraph 115(c) of the NPPF.

## Internal Junction Design Deficiencies

While Oxfordshire County Council states that "dimensions look acceptable for the spine road and associated pedestrian and cycle infrastructure," Active Travel England identifies a critical omission: the lack of "side road treatments to enhance priority and continuity for vulnerable road users," referencing Figure 10.13 of LTN 1/20.

Section 10.5 of LTN 1/20 requires that priority crossings at side roads should be continuous and prioritised for cyclists and pedestrians. Figure 10.13 illustrates the required design: raised table crossings maintaining the level of the footway and cycle track, with the carriageway rising to meet them. The application provides no evidence of these treatments at internal junctions, meaning cyclists will be required to give way repeatedly when crossing side roads, undermining the coherence and directness required by LTN 1/20.

Active Travel England's response notes that "Shared-use routes appear to terminate at multiple points, requiring users to cross the highway frequently rather than following a direct, coherent route through the site." This design approach is contrary to the core principle of coherence set out in Section 4.2 of LTN 1/20. Additionally, the Oxfordshire County Council response identifies multiple locations where dropped kerbs are missing, further compromising accessibility.

## Excessive Car Parking and Car-Dependent Design

The proposal provides 1,349 car parking spaces, representing a ratio of approximately 1 space per 120 square metres of floorspace. Oxfordshire County Council's response states: "there is a concern that a potential overprovision of car parking may encourage more people to use the private car as opposed to alternative sustainable modes of travel."

This concern is well-founded. Paragraph 117(a) of the NPPF is clear that within local parking standards, "the needs of people with disabilities must be taken into account, while ensuring that low car households are not disadvantaged." More fundamentally, it requires developments to "give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and with neighbouring areas." The provision of 1,349 car parking spaces does the opposite: it prioritises and enables car use while providing no safe cycling infrastructure to the site.

The Transport Assessment uses existing census modal split data showing 80% driving, 2% cycling, and acknowledges that without improvements, the site would generate only 18 active travel trips in the morning peak hour. The assessment then states that "improvements including a new bus service, on-site bus stops and improvements to pedestrian and cycle links" justify not applying modal shift reductions, but contradictorily applies worst-case trip rates anyway (paragraph 5.6). This is not the "vision-led" approach required by the definition of Transport Assessments in Annex 2 of the NPPF. It is "predict and provide" for car dependency.

Oxfordshire County Council's Local Transport and Connectivity Plan aims to "Replace or remove 1 out of every 4 current car trips in Oxfordshire by 2030." The Bicester Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan, Policy BCW 1, requires "a 200% increase in cycling trips within Bicester over the next 10 years." This development achieves neither target. By providing excessive car parking without safe cycling infrastructure, it locks in car dependency for decades and undermines the Council's own climate emergency declaration and sustainable transport policies.

This is contrary to Policy SLE4 of the Cherwell Local Plan Part 1, which requires developments to "facilitate the use of sustainable modes of transport to make them the preferred choice of travel." The application facilitates car use, not sustainable transport.

## Inadequate Transport Assessment

The Transport Assessment fundamentally misrepresents the site's accessibility by sustainable modes. Paragraph 5.4 claims "good level of accessibility by sustainable modes with NCN Route 51 located to the south." National Cycle Network Route 51 is actually over 1.5 kilometres away across the M40 motorway with no safe connection to the site. This misrepresentation goes to the heart of the application's case for sustainability.

The modal split assumptions are unrealistic. The assessment uses existing census data showing 2% cycling and 80% car use, acknowledges that the site's isolated location would perpetuate this pattern, but then fails to apply the modal shift reductions permitted by Oxfordshire County Council's "Decide & Provide" guidance. The result is an assessment that validates car dependency rather than challenging it, contrary to paragraph 113 of the NPPF, which requires Transport Assessments to be "vision-led."

The peak hour vehicle movements (348 arrivals in the 0800-0900 hour, 316 departures in the 1700-1800 hour) represent a significant traffic impact. These movements are presented as unavoidable consequences of the site's function, yet no serious effort has been made to reduce them through genuine sustainable transport provision.

## Travel Plan Deficiencies

Oxfordshire County Council requires each of the nine units to have a **separate Travel Plan** meeting the criteria in Appendix 5 of the "Transport for New Developments" guidance. The application submits a single generic travel plan dated 21 January 2025, failing to meet this requirement.

More fundamentally, Oxfordshire County Council's response acknowledges the reality: "There appears to be a lack of off-site pedestrian/cycling infrastructure. Without this it is unlikely that cycling and walking will be a mode of choice." Travel Plans cannot overcome infrastructure deficiencies. Without safe cycle routes to Bicester town centre (4 kilometres away), Chesterton village (1.5 kilometres), and Wendlebury, the modal shift targets in any Travel Plan are unachievable. This represents a fundamental mismatch between the Travel Plan's ambitions and the infrastructure reality, contrary to paragraph 118 of the NPPF, which states that Travel Plans should be supported by appropriate infrastructure.

The application proposes a "bus service contribution for a bus service to coincide with shift patterns," which is welcomed, but no costed scheme, service specification, frequency, routing, operating hours, or long-term funding mechanism is provided. Without these details, the genuine availability of public transport as an alternative to car use cannot be assessed.

## Recommendations

To make this development acceptable, Bicester BUG requests that the following fundamental changes be required:

### 1. A41 Cycle Route Delivery Before Occupation

The applicant must provide detailed design, full funding, and a binding legal obligation to deliver a shared footway/cycleway from the site access to Bicester Park & Ride before any unit is occupied. This must meet the standards in LTN 1/20, including:

- Minimum 3.0-metre width, segregated from the footway where pedestrian flows warrant it (Table 5-2 of LTN 1/20)
- Toucan crossings on all desire lines
- Continuous priority at side roads with raised table crossings (Figure 10.13 of LTN 1/20)
- Lighting to BS 5489 standards
- Comprehensive wayfinding and signage

The application must clarify whether this development contributes to the £2.8 million secured from the Siemens development in 2022 or whether additional funding is provided. Land within the redline boundary must be safeguarded for this route with a Section 278 Agreement ensuring delivery before first occupation.

### 2. Green Lane Route Extension and Upgrade

The pedestrian/cycle route must be extended to Vespasian Way as required by Oxfordshire County Council. The better option is to provide a segregated 3.0-metre-wide cycle track along the full length of Green Lane to Chesterton with priority crossings at side roads, as required by Figure 4.1 of LTN 1/20 for roads with 40mph speed limits. The speed limit should be reduced to 20mph with traffic calming, and raised table crossings provided at the unnamed junction and all side roads, with continuous lighting to adoptable standards.

### 3. Cycle Parking Redesign

Detailed drawings must be submitted showing:

- Minimum 50% Sheffield stands at ground level (not double-stacked)
- Covered, secure, naturally surveilled parking within 20 metres of each unit entrance, as recommended in Chapter 11 of LTN 1/20
- Segregated provision for cargo bikes, adapted cycles, and mobility scooters as required by Oxfordshire County Council standards
- A cycle maintenance station with pump, tools, and repair stand as requested by the County Council

### 4. Internal Route Priority Treatments

Raised table side road treatments must be provided at all internal junctions, giving continuous priority to pedestrians and cyclists as shown in Figure 10.13 of LTN 1/20. The main spine road must provide a minimum 2.0-metre segregated footway and 2.0-metre cycle track (Table 5-2 of LTN 1/20). Coherent, continuous routes must be provided without requiring cyclists to cross the carriageway multiple times. Dropped kerbs with tactile paving must be provided at all crossing points.

### 5. Reduction in Car Parking

Car parking provision must be reduced to a maximum of 1 space per 150 square metres (maximum 1,089 spaces) to align with Oxfordshire County Council's Local Transport and Connectivity Plan target of removing 1 in 4 car trips by 2030 and with paragraph 117(a) of the NPPF requiring priority for sustainable modes. Land safeguarded for additional cycle parking should be provided instead. Maximum parking standards should be implemented rather than minimum standards.

### 6. Unit-Specific Travel Plans

Nine separate, unit-specific Travel Plans must be submitted meeting the criteria in Appendix 5 of Oxfordshire County Council's "Transport for New Developments" guidance. These must include SMART modal shift targets achieving a minimum 15% cycle mode share by year 3 (from the 2% baseline), with annual monitoring, reporting, and penalties for non-compliance. The £29,385 monitoring fee (£3,265 per unit, RPI index-linked) must be secured.

### 7. Bus Service Specification

A detailed, costed bus service proposal must be provided with:

- Service frequency of at least 30 minutes during peak periods and hourly off-peak
- Operating hours matching shift patterns (0600-2200 minimum)
- Routing through Bicester town centre
- Real-time passenger information at stops
- Long-term funding mechanism for a minimum of 10 years

This should be secured through Section 106 agreement to ensure genuine public transport access as required by paragraph 117(a) of the NPPF.

### 8. Wayfinding and Signage Strategy

A comprehensive wayfinding strategy must be provided showing distances and cycling times to key destinations, integration with Bicester Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan cycle route numbering, and Legible London-style mapping at key decision points.

### 9. Monitoring and Adaptive Management

Automatic traffic counters must be installed at all access routes recording vehicle and cycle movements. Annual reports must be submitted demonstrating modal split, cycle parking occupancy, and comparison against Travel Plan targets, with triggers for additional sustainable transport measures if car mode share exceeds 70% after year 2. This monitoring approach aligns with Oxfordshire County Council's "Decide and Provide" methodology.

## Conclusion

This application represents a fundamental conflict between 21st-century policy aspirations for sustainable transport and 20th-century "predict and provide" development for car dependency. It proposes 1,218 cycle parking spaces at a site with no safe way for employees to cycle to work. It claims to support sustainable transport while providing 1,349 car parking spaces and generating 348 vehicle arrivals in the morning peak hour. It promises
