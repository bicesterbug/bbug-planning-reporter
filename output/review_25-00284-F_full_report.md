| Aspect | Rating | Key Issue |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Documentation | RED | No transport documents available for review |
| Cycle Parking | RED | No details provided on quantity, type, location or security |
| Cycle Routes | RED | No evidence of cycle connectivity assessment |
| Junctions | RED | No junction design information available |
| Permeability | RED | No assessment of walking/cycling access |

## Critical Documentation Deficiency

**This application cannot be properly assessed from a cycling perspective as no application documents have been made available for review.** For a major employment development of this scale, the following documents should be submitted and publicly accessible:

### Required Documents (Missing):
1. **Transport Assessment/Statement** (NPPF para 118 requirement)
2. **Travel Plan** (NPPF para 118 requirement)
3. **Cycle Parking Strategy**
4. **Site Layout Plans** showing cycle infrastructure
5. **Design and Access Statement** with active travel considerations
6. **Junction Design Details** for A41 access
7. **Connectivity Assessment** to existing cycle network

The absence of these documents represents a fundamental failure to comply with NPPF paragraph 109, which requires transport issues to be "considered from the earliest stages" and paragraph 117(a) which requires applications to "give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements."

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Cycle Parking

**Status: Cannot Assess - No Information Provided**

#### Required Standards (LTN 1/20 Chapter 14):
For B2/B8 employment uses, the application must demonstrate:

- **Quantum:** Number of cycle parking spaces based on employee numbers and visitor requirements
- **Type:** Mix of short-stay (Sheffield stands, minimum) and long-stay (covered, secure) facilities
- **Location:** Within 50m of building entrances, more convenient than car parking
- **Security:** Covered, well-lit, CCTV monitored for long-stay
- **Quality:** Compliance with Table 14.1 of LTN 1/20

**Critical Concern:** The proposal mentions "cycle parking" but provides no detail whatsoever on:
- How many spaces?
- Where located on site?
- What type/quality?
- How secured?

This is wholly inadequate for a major employment allocation.

#### Policy Non-Compliance:
- **LTN 1/20 Chapter 14.3.17:** "The design of cycle facilities within new highways constructed in developments should adhere to the guidance given in the relevant chapters contained in this document... the expectation is that high quality cycle facilities should be provided in all new developments."
- **NPPF para 109(e):** "identifying and pursuing opportunities to promote walking, cycling and public transport use"

### 2. Cycle Route Provision

**Status: Critical Failure - No Evidence of Assessment**

#### Site Context Issues:

This site is located on the **Wendlebury parish boundary near Chesterton**, which presents severe challenges for sustainable access:

**Distance Analysis (estimated):**
- Chesterton village: ~1km
- Bicester town centre: ~4-5km  
- M40 Junction 9: Adjacent (hostile environment)
- A41: Direct frontage (60mph dual carriageway)

**Existing Infrastructure Assessment:**
According to the Bicester LCWIP, the cycle network quality in this area is likely to be poor or non-existent. The site appears to be in a rural/edge location with:
- No existing cycle routes to the site
- A41 providing severance and danger
- Rural roads without cycle provision
- Significant distance from residential areas

#### What Should Be Provided:

**On-site (LTN 1/20 Chapter 14):**
- Internal cycle network meeting Core Design Principles (Coherent, Direct, Safe, Comfortable, Attractive)
- Segregated cycle tracks where motor traffic volume/speed warrants (Figure 4.1)
- Dutch-style junction treatments
- Design speed of 30 kph (Table 5-4) minimum, 20 kph absolute minimum

**Off-site Connectivity:**
The application **must** demonstrate safe cycle routes from:
1. Bicester town centre (nearest significant residential area)
2. Chesterton village
3. Wendlebury (if applicable)
4. Any public transport nodes

**LTN 1/20 Figure 4.1 Requirements:**
For the A41 (assumed >40mph, >6000 PCU/day), **protected space for cycling is mandatory** - either:
- Stepped cycle tracks (minimum 2.0m width, Table 5-2)
- Fully kerbed cycle tracks
- Light segregation (if HGV traffic limited and <6000 PCU/day)

Shared use paths on footways are **not acceptable** in urban contexts (LTN 1/20 6.5.4: "should be regarded as a last resort").

#### Policy Non-Compliance:
- **LTN 1/20 14.3.19:** "A cycle network plan should be included in the design code"
- **Bicester LCWIP Policy:** Developments must provide "safe and attractive walking and cycling connections to the site"
- **Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2(b):** "all new developments have safe and attractive walking and cycling connections to the site"

**No evidence provided of any cycle connectivity assessment.**

### 3. Junction Design

**Status: Critical Failure - No Information**

#### A41 Signalised Access:

The proposal accesses from "the existing A41 signalised access" but provides **no information** on:

- How cyclists will safely cross the A41
- Junction design for cycle movements
- Integration with any Toucan crossings
- Compliance with LTN 1/20 Chapter 6 junction standards

**LTN 1/20 Requirements:**

The junction must provide (Chapter 6):
- Separate cycle signal phases where necessary
- Avoid shared use areas forcing conflict (6.5.4)
- Protected space through junction (Figure 4.1)
- Appropriate deflection and geometry for cycle safety
- Consideration of design speed (minimum 20 kph, Table 5-4)

**Specific Concern - HGV Movements:**

B8 (storage/distribution) uses generate significant HGV traffic. The junction design must demonstrate:
- Safe separation of cycle movements from HGV turning movements
- Adequate visibility splays for all users
- Protection from swept paths of articulated vehicles
- Compliance with LTN 1/20 junction design principles

#### Policy Non-Compliance:
- **NPPF para 115(a):** Applications must "give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements"
- **NPPF para 115(b):** Must ensure "safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users"
- **LTN 1/20 Chapter 6:** Extensive junction design requirements not addressed

### 4. Pedestrian & Cycle Permeability

**Status: Cannot Assess - No Information**

#### Required Assessment:

For a site of this scale, the application must demonstrate:

**Internal Permeability:**
- Walking routes to/from all employment areas to cycle parking
- Maximum 50m from any workplace to cycle parking
- Pedestrian priority within site
- Filtered permeability (cyclists can move freely, motor traffic controlled)

**External Permeability:**
- How pedestrians/cyclists access the site from surrounding area
- Connections to existing PRoW network
- Desire line analysis
- Barrier removal (A41 severance, M40 proximity)

**LTN 1/20 Chapter 14.3.15-16:**
Networks must be:
- **Coherent:** Legible routes forming a high-quality grid
- **Direct:** Following desire lines, not circuitous
- **Safe:** Protected from motor traffic danger
- **Comfortable:** Smooth surfaces, adequate width, low gradients
- **Attractive:** Pleasant environment encouraging use

**No evidence of any permeability assessment provided.**

#### Policy Non-Compliance:
- **Manual for Streets:** Walking/cycling routes should be more direct than motor routes
- **Bicester LCWIP Outcome 3:** Need to address "disconnected street network and significant severance"
- **Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2(b):** Internal routes must "connect easily and conveniently to community facilities and the local cycle and walking network"

### 5. Transport Assessment Review

**Status: CRITICAL - No Transport Assessment Available**

#### NPPF Requirements:

**Paragraph 118:** "All developments that will generate significant amounts of movement should be required to provide a travel plan, and the application should be supported by a vision-led transport statement or transport assessment."

This B2/B8 employment development will **unquestionably** generate significant movements. The absence of a Transport Assessment is a fundamental policy failure.

#### What the TA Should Include:

1. **Trip Generation:**
   - Employee numbers (AM/PM peaks)
   - Visitor numbers
   - HGV movements
   - Baseline modal split assumptions

2. **Modal Shift Analysis:**
   - Current modal split for employment sites
   - Target modal split (with cycling infrastructure)
   - Measures to achieve targets
   - Link to Travel Plan

3. **Cycle Demand Assessment:**
   - Catchment area analysis
   - Potential cycle trips from residential areas
   - Justification for cycle parking provision
   - Network capacity requirements

4. **Impact Assessment:**
   - Effects on existing cycle routes (if any)
   - Junction safety analysis for all modes
   - Cumulative impact with other developments

5. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - On-site cycle infrastructure
   - Off-site improvements to cycle network
   - Contribution to Bicester LCWIP schemes
   - Monitoring and enforcement

#### Likely Issues (Based on Site Context):

Without seeing the TA, the following concerns are anticipated:

**Modal Split Assumptions:**
- Out-of-town employment sites typically assume 90%+ car mode share
- This is policy non-compliant with NPPF "vision-led" approach
- Should demonstrate how 10-20% cycle mode share can be achieved

**Accessibility:**
- Site appears to have very poor cycle accessibility
- May be "predict and provide" car-based approach
- Conflicts with NPPF para 110 sustainable location requirements

**Network Impact:**
- Likely to generate hundreds of car trips in peak hours
- Impact on A41/local network not assessed
- Cycling alternatives not properly considered

#### Policy Non-Compliance:
- **NPPF para 118:** Mandatory requirement for TA/TS not met
- **NPPF Glossary (Transport Assessment):** Must "identify measures required to support alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling"
- **NPPF para 109:** "Vision-led approach to identify transport solutions" - no evidence of this

### 6. Travel Plan

**Status: CRITICAL - No Travel Plan Submitted**

#### NPPF Requirements:

**Paragraph 118** requires a Travel Plan for all developments generating significant movement.

**NPPF Glossary Definition:** Travel Plan is "a long-term management strategy for an organisation or site that details how agreed sustainable transport objectives are to be delivered."

#### Required Travel Plan Content:

For a B2/B8 employment development, the Travel Plan must include:

1. **Baseline Assessment:**
   - Current travel patterns to site
   - Accessibility by all modes
   - Barriers to cycling/walking

2. **Targets:**
   - Specific modal shift targets (e.g., 15% cycle mode share by Year 3)
   - Reduction in single-occupancy car trips
   - Measurable, time-bound objectives

3. **Measures:**
   - Cycle parking provision (quantity/quality)
   - Changing/shower facilities for cyclists
   - Cycle purchase schemes/loans
   - Cycle training for employees
   - Guaranteed ride home scheme
   - Car parking management/pricing
   - Personalised travel planning
   - Bicycle user group

4. **Infrastructure Commitments:**
   - On-site cycle routes
   - Off-site improvements
   - Financial contributions to cycle network

5. **Monitoring & Review:**
   - Annual travel surveys
   - Review of targets
   - Remedial measures if targets not met
   - Secured through Section 106 agreement

**No Travel Plan has been submitted.**

#### Policy Non-Compliance:
- **NPPF para 118:** Mandatory requirement not met
- **Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2:** Developments must demonstrate sustainable transport provision
- **Bicester LCWIP:** Employment sites must contribute to modal shift targets

## Site-Specific Concerns

### Location & Sustainability

This site raises fundamental questions about compliance with NPPF para 110:

> "Significant development should be focused on locations which are or can be made sustainable, through limiting the need to travel and offering a genuine choice of transport modes."

**Questions for the Applicant:**

1. **Can this site be "made sustainable"?** 
   - It appears to be 4-5km from Bicester, adjacent to the M40/A41
   - Creating safe cycle routes across this distance would require significant off-site infrastructure
   - No evidence this has been considered or costed

2. **Does it offer "genuine choice of transport modes"?**
   - No bus service information provided
   - Cycle accessibility appears very poor
   - Walking distance to residential areas excessive
   - Likely to be 95%+ car-dependent

3. **Is this an appropriate location for employment development from a sustainable transport perspective?**
   - Prima facie appears to fail NPPF para 110 test
   - Should be compared against alternative sites closer to Bicester with better active travel potential

### Integration with Bicester LCWIP

The Bicester LCWIP identifies significant challenges with cycle infrastructure and sets out a comprehensive network plan. This development must demonstrate:

1. **Contribution to LCWIP Network:**
   - Which LCWIP routes does it connect to?
   - What off-site improvements are needed?
   - Financial contribution to scheme delivery?

2. **LCWIP Outcome Alignment:**
   - **Outcome 1:** "Delivering missing links" - what links does this create?
   - **Outcome 3:** "Better physical linking" - how does this address severance?
   - **Outcome 5:** "Ease of movement for all" - is this accessible to all ages/abilities?
   - **Outcome 6:** "Shift away from private car use" - what modal shift will this achieve?

**The application makes no reference to the Bicester LCWIP.**

This is a significant policy failure given Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2(c): "Work closely with stakeholders using co-production methods when developing and improving cycle and walking networks."

### HGV/Cycle Interaction

B8 (storage and distribution) uses generate significant HGV movements. The application must address:

1. **Routing:** How are HGVs routed to avoid conflict with cycle routes?
2. **Junction Design:** How are cycles protected from HGV swept paths and blind spots?
3. **Site Layout:** Are cycle routes segregated from HGV circulation areas?
4. **Safety Assessment:** Specific HGV-cycle conflict risk assessment required

**No information provided on any of these critical safety issues.**

## Conclusion

This application is **fundamentally deficient** from a cycling and sustainable transport perspective. The complete absence of:
- Transport Assessment
- Travel Plan  
- Cycle infrastructure details
- Route connectivity assessment
- Junction designs

...represents a wholesale failure to comply with national and local policy requirements.

**The application should be REFUSED or deemed INVALID until compliant documentation is submitted.**

Even with full documentation, this site's location adjacent to the A41/M40, 4-5km from Bicester, raises serious questions about whether it can ever be "made sustainable" as required by NPPF para 110.

**Key Policy Conflicts:**
- NPPF para 110: Inappropriate location for sustainable development
- NPPF para 118: Mandatory TA/Travel Plan not submitted
- NPPF para 117(a): No evidence of priority to cycle movements
- LTN 1/20 Chapter 14: No cycle network or parking details
- Oxfordshire LTCP Policy 2: No safe cycle connections demonstrated
- Bicester LCWIP: No integration with adopted network plans

**We strongly recommend OBJECTION to this application** unless and until the applicant demonstrates:
1. Comprehensive Transport Assessment with vision-led approach
2. Deliverable Travel Plan with ambitious modal shift targets
3. High-quality cycle infrastructure on and off-site complying with LTN 1/20
4. Safe, direct, coherent cycle routes to Bicester and surrounding areas
5. Significant financial contribution to LCWIP delivery

The burden is on the applicant to demonstrate this out-of-town site can be made genuinely accessible by sustainable modes. **Current evidence: zero. Current assessment: non-compliant.**
