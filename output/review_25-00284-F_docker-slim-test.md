## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Cycle Parking

**Quantity:**
The proposal provides 1,218 cycle parking spaces across the site (circa 1 space per 6-7 staff members), exceeding the minimum standard of 1,185 spaces. This represents approximately 0.9 spaces per parking space, which is commendable for an employment development.

**Quality Concerns:**
- **Double-stacking:** The TA states parking "will be achieved through provision of double-stacked spaces" (para 4.15). This raises serious accessibility concerns:
  - LTN 1/20 Section 11.2.7 states: "Two-tier cycle parking should only be considered where there is very high demand and space is at a premium"
  - Double-stacking discriminates against less physically able users, wheelchair users, cargo bike users, and adapted cycles
  - OCC standards require provision for "cycles for disabled people and other needs (such as tricycles, cargo bikes, tandems, mobility scooters and adapted bicycles)"

- **Design Details Missing:** The Active Travel England (ATE) response specifically states: "detailed cycle parking drawings are absent. ATE requests these drawings to ensure compliance with LTN 1/20 and local standards"
  
- **Location and Security:** While the Design and Access Statement mentions "secure, covered cycle parking...located near office entrances" with "shower and changing facilities," no detailed drawings demonstrate:
  - Covered provision as per LTN 1/20 Table 11-1
  - Sheffield stands or equivalent at ground level
  - Natural surveillance
  - Proximity to building entrances (within 20m desirable)
  - Lighting and CCTV provision
  - Segregation from vehicle traffic

**Cycle Maintenance:** OCC's response requests "a cycle maintenance station" which is welcomed but not detailed in application documents.

**Policy Compliance:**
- **LTN 1/20 Chapter 11:** Requirements for cycle parking quality not demonstrated
- **OCC Parking Standards:** Inclusive cycling provision for adapted cycles not evidenced

### 2. Cycle Route Provision

This is the most problematic aspect of the application, with fundamental failures in providing coherent, safe connections to the wider cycle network.

**Off-Site Connectivity - Critical Failures:**

**A41 Pedestrian/Cycle Link:**
- The site benefits from a consented signalised access on the A41 with toucan crossings
- The previous Siemens development (22/01144/F) secured a £2.8 million contribution for a shared footway/cycleway between the site and Bicester Park & Ride
- **However:** This route remains undefined, undelivered, and unfunded
- OCC's response (Rashid Bbosa) states: "Active Travel provisions associated with this access do not provide a direct route into Bicester besides linking to Footpaths 398/1/20 and 161/4/20"
- OCC now requires safeguarding of "a strip of land along their frontages on the A41 for this infrastructure"
- **The application fails to demonstrate this safeguarding or commitment to delivery**

**Green Lane Connection - Safety Critical Issue:**
- A 3.7m wide emergency access/pedestrian route is proposed northwards to Green Lane
- This connects to a 2m footway along Green Lane but **terminates at an unnamed junction** where "pedestrians would be forced to walk on the narrow carriageway towards Chesterton along a 40mph signed speed limit section"
- **OCC states this is a "Reason for Objection"** and requires extension to Vespasian Way
- ATE highlights: "The 40mph speed limit along this route is concerning, particularly with regards to crossings"
- The onward route crosses footpath 161/1/120 which is "unlikely to be suitable for most users at all times of the day and year"

**Policy Non-Compliance:**
- **LTN 1/20 Section 14.3.15:** Networks must be "Coherent" and "Direct" - the Green Lane route fails both tests by terminating unsafely
- **NPPF para 115(a):** Requires "sustainable transport modes are prioritised" - this is not achieved
- **Bicester LCWIP:** Identifies need for comprehensive networks accessible from every neighbourhood - this development creates an isolated employment site

**On-Site Provision:**

**Positive Aspects:**
- Internal spine road includes pedestrian footways on both sides
- Segregated pedestrian/cycle routes proposed within the development
- Width of spine road appears adequate (subject to detailed review)

**Concerns:**
- ATE states routes "appear to be designed primarily as footways" rather than proper cycle infrastructure
- "Shared-use routes appear to terminate at multiple points, requiring users to cross the highway frequently rather than following a direct, coherent route through the site"
- Missing side road priority treatments: "improvements should be made to pedestrian and cycling provision by incorporating side road treatments to enhance priority and continuity" (ref. LTN 1/20 Figure 10.13)
- Dropped kerbs missing at multiple locations per OCC response
- Bollards required at Green Lane connection "for purposes of restricting ordinary vehicles from cutting through as a rat-run"

**LTN 1/20 Non-Compliance:**
- **Section 4.4.4 & Figure 4.1:** On roads with 40mph+ speeds (Green Lane, A41), protected space for cycling is required - not provided
- **Section 6.5.4:** "In urban areas, the conversion of a footway to shared use should be regarded as a last resort" - yet this appears to be the default approach
- **Table 5-2:** For 2-way cycle tracks serving this level of development, minimum 3.0m width required (desirable) - Green Lane provides only 3.7m total including emergency vehicle access

### 3. Junction Design

**External Junctions:**
- A41 signalised access is consented under previous application and includes toucan crossings
- M40 Junction 9 improvements proposed as mitigation
- No cycle-specific improvements demonstrated at Vendee Drive roundabout (despite OCC seeking contributions)

**Internal Junctions:**
- OCC states "dimensions look acceptable for the spine road and associated pedestrian and cycle infrastructure"
- However, ATE notes lack of "side road treatments to enhance priority and continuity for vulnerable road users" referencing LTN 1/20 Figure 10.13
- No raised tables at side roads demonstrated
- Cycle priority at junctions not evidenced

**LTN 1/20 Chapter 10 Compliance:**
- **Section 10.5:** Priority crossings at side roads should be continuous and prioritised - not demonstrated
- **Figure 10.13:** Shows required design for priority crossings - not provided
- Car parking access junctions should give continuous priority to cycle tracks - no evidence of this

### 4. Pedestrian & Cycle Permeability

**Filtered Permeability:**
- Development includes emergency access to Green Lane with bollards to prevent rat-running (positive)
- However, no evidence of broader filtered permeability strategy
- Large employment site with potential to create "dead" edges

**Rights of Way:**
- Footpaths 398/1/20 and 161/4/20 are nearby but connections not clearly demonstrated
- OCC requires various conditions including: "Any works to a public right of way must be approved in writing prior to any disturbance to the surface"
- Diversion routes during construction not detailed

**Wayfinding:**
- No wayfinding or signage strategy demonstrated
- Bicester LCWIP specifically identifies wayfinding as critical outcome
- Cycle route numbering/branding not proposed

**Positive Aspects:**
- Multiple access points (A41, Green Lane, emergency access) provide some permeability
- Internal footway connections between units proposed
- MUGA provision demonstrates some commitment to active use

### 5. Transport Assessment Review

**Modal Split Assumptions:**

The TA presents existing travel patterns based on census data:
- **80% driving a car or van**
- **2% by bicycle**
- **4% on foot**
- **5% public transport**

The TA acknowledges: "should no improvements be accounted for, it could be expected that the site would generate 15 public transport movements between 0700-0800 and 10 movements between 0800-0900...Active travel would likely account for 18 trips between 0700-0800 and 12 trips at 0800-0900" (para 5.8).

**Critical Issues:**

1. **Unrealistic Modal Shift Expectations:** The TA claims "improvements including a new bus service, on-site bus stops and improvements to pedestrian and cycle links" justify not applying modal shift reductions, yet states: "to provide a robust assessment the trips outlined in Table 5.1 have formed the basis of the analysis" (para 5.6). This is contradictory.

2. **OCC Policy Conflict:** 
   - OCC LTCP aims to "Replace or remove 1 out of every 4 current car trips in Oxfordshire by 2030"
   - Bicester LCWIP Policy BCW 1 requires "a 200% increase in cycling trips within Bicester over the next 10 years"
   - **This development does nothing to achieve these targets** - it locks in car dependency

3. **Car Parking Oversupply:** 
   - 1,349 car parking spaces (1 per 120sqm) represents a "middle ground" between warehouse (1:300) and industrial (1:75) standards
   - OCC states: "there is a concern that a potential overprovision of car parking may encourage more people to use the private car as opposed to alternative sustainable modes of travel"
   - This directly contradicts NPPF para 117(a) requirement to "give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements"

4. **Trip Generation:**
   - Peak hour vehicle movements: 348 AM (0800-0900) and 316 PM (1700-1800) above consented Siemens development
   - **These are worst-case HGV shift patterns (0700-0800) but use typical network peak hours for analysis** - methodologically inconsistent

5. **Accessibility Assessment Inadequate:**
   - TA claims "good level of accessibility by sustainable modes with NCN Route 51 located to the south"
   - NCN 51 is actually **1.5km+ away across the M40** with no safe connection
   - This fundamentally misrepresents accessibility

**Policy Non-Compliance:**
- **NPPF para 113:** Transport Assessments must be "vision-led" and identify measures for sustainable transport - this is "predict and provide" for cars
- **Cherwell Local Plan Policy SLE4:** Requires developments to "facilitate the use of sustainable modes of transport" - the opposite is achieved
- **OCC Decide & Provide guidance:** Allows modal shift reductions to be applied - not done

### 6. Travel Plan Issues

**OCC Requirements:**
- Each of 9 units requires **separate Travel Plan** meeting OCC criteria
- Travel Plans required "prior to occupation of each unit and then updated within 3 months of occupation"
- Monitoring fee: £29,385 (£3,265 per unit) RPI index-linked

**Submitted Travel Plan Inadequacy:**
- Single travel plan dated 21 January 2025 submitted
- Does not meet requirement for unit-specific plans
- OCC response states: "There appears to be a lack of off-site pedestrian/cycling infrastructure. Without this it is unlikely that cycling and walking will be a mode of choice"

**Bus Service Commitment:**
- TA proposes "bus service contribution for a bus service to coincide with shift patterns" (welcomed by OCC)
- However, no costed scheme or service specification provided
- No details on frequency, routing, operating hours, or long-term funding

**Reality Check:**
Travel Plans alone cannot overcome fundamental infrastructure deficiencies. Without safe, direct cycle routes to Bicester town centre (4km away), Chesterton village (1.5km), and Wendlebury, modal shift targets are unachievable.

---

## Summary and Recommendation

**This application should be REFUSED or, at minimum, subject to fundamental redesign.**

### Reasons for Refusal:

1. **Failure to provide safe, coherent cycle access** contrary to LTN 1/20 core design principles (coherent, direct, safe, comfortable, attractive networks), NPPF paragraphs 115(a) and 117(a), and Cherwell Local Plan Policy SLE4.

2. **Unsustainable location with inadequate infrastructure** contrary to NPPF para 110 (development should be in locations which are or can be made sustainable), Cherwell Local Plan Policy SLE1 (employment proposals must have good access by sustainable modes), and OCC LTCP targets.

3. **Provision of excessive car parking** that will entrench car dependency contrary to NPPF para 117(a) (priority to pedestrian/cycle movements), OCC LTCP target to remove 1 in 4 car trips, and Bicester LCWIP target for 200% increase in cycling.

4. **Failure to demonstrate policy-compliant cycle parking** contrary to LTN 1/20 Chapter 11 standards, OCC inclusive cycling requirements, and Equality Act 2010 Public Sector Equality Duty.

5. **Unsafe termination of Green Lane cycle/pedestrian route** creating danger to users contrary to NPPF para 115(b) (safe and suitable access for all users) and LTN 1/20 requirement for coherent networks - identified by OCC as "Reason for Objection."

### The Fundamental Problem:

This is a large-scale employment development (163,338 sqm, 1,800+ employees) in an isolated location **4km from Bicester town centre** with:
- No safe, direct cycle route to the town
- No footway along the A41
- A Green Lane connection that dumps cyclists onto a 40mph road with no onward route
- An assumption that 80% of trips will be by car
- Provision of 1,349 car parking spaces to accommodate that car dependency

This is precisely the type of development that should not be approved in 2025 given the climate emergency, public health crisis from inactivity, and statutory requirements to promote sustainable transport.

### The £2.8 Million Question:

The previous Siemens development secured £2.8 million for an A41 cycle route **in 2022** (ref 22/01144/F). Three years later:
- The route is undesigned
- The route is undelivered
- This application provides no clarity on whether it contributes to that fund
- This application makes the same promises that were made before

**How many more employment developments will be approved before safe cycle access is actually delivered?**

### What Would Make This Acceptable:

The development could potentially be made acceptable with:

1. **Full funding and delivery** of the A41 cycle route (not just contribution or safeguarding) **before any occupation**
2. **Complete redesign** of Green Lane connection with segregated cycle track to Chesterton
3. **50% reduction in car parking** (maximum 1:200 ratio for B8 uses)
4. **Ground-level, covered cycle parking** for all spaces with inclusive provision
5. **Binding, enforceable** Travel Plans with meaningful modal shift targets and penalties

Without these fundamental changes, this development will:
- Increase car dependency in Bicester
- Undermine Bicester LCWIP modal shift targets
- Lock in unsustainable travel patterns for decades
- Discriminate against non-car users
- Contradict Cherwell District Council's own climate emergency declaration

### Conclusion:

Local cycling groups should **strongly object** to this application and call for refusal unless the fundamental infrastructure deficiencies are remedied. The provision of 1,218 cycle parking spaces is meaningless if employees have no safe way to cycle to work.

The application represents 20th-century "predict and provide" car-dependent development masquerading as sustainable through token gestures to cycling. It fails to meet the vision-led, sustainable transport requirements of the NPPF, LTN 1/20, and local policy.

**Recommendation: OBJECT and request REFUSAL** unless comprehensively redesigned with binding obligations to deliver safe cycle infrastructure before occupation.
